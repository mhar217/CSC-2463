Project Title: Jackpotter
Webpage: https://mhar217.github.io/CSC-2463/Jackpot/

Description:
"Jackpotter" is a concentration game similar to the arcade game Cyclone where players keep track of multiple lights flashing in a pattern, 
attempting to stop the pattern on a certain color of light. As players continue with the game, 
the pattern will change, and the game ends when the playerâ€™s jackpot streak is broken. 
The game increases in difficulty as the player continuously succeeds in landing on the correct color, 
increasing the speed at which the lights flash. Players will press a button an appropriate distance away 
from other implements and the streak score will be shown on the screen, increasing with each success.
